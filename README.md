# üöÄ Be The Hero üöÄ
This project was executed during the week OmniStack, directed by Diego Fernandes CTO of @rocketseat .
The project consists of an application for NGO's (Non-Governmental Organization), in order to get supporters (financial) to contribute to the organization.

In the Frontend the NGO registers, receives a Login ID and registers its cases with Name, a description of the situation and the amount that needs to be collected for that situation.

In the mobile App, the "angel" (supporter), has a list of all situations, with the location and values ‚Äã‚Äãof each one and manages to contact via email or whatsapp (integrated in the app to open with the data of the chosen situation) and support the project.
